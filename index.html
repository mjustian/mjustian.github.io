				<h3><a href="https://mjustian.itch.io/494-zelda">Classic Game - The Legend of Zelda, First Dungeon</a></h3>
				<p>I worked with a group of 2 other people, specifically <a href="https://jackkolbert.github.io/">Jack Kolbert</a> and 
				<a href="https://alambkin.github.io">Azaan Lambkin</a> to create a remake of the Eagle dungeon from "The Legend of Zelda".
				My main contributions include writing the code for the UI, items, the boss, movement for the Keese (bat enemies), doors with keys,
				and map transitions, as well as adding sound.

				<h3><a href="https://mjustian.itch.io/monster-vs-mayor">Rapid Prototype - Monster vs. Mayor</a></h3>
				<p>This is a two-player city-building/city-smashing PC game that I made in two weeks. One player, using the mouse, must
					build a city. The other player controls a monster using the keyboard or a controller, and they must destroy that very city.
					I designed and programmed almost all aspects of the game, even learing 3D modeling with Blender. Some of the other assets,
					mainly sound effects, were from external sources.

				<h3><a href="https://draden494.itch.io/the-story-of-draden">The Story of Draden</a></h3>
				<p>
					Deep in the forest, our hero, Draden was struck with a mysterious spell that transformed him into a fearsome dragon. Now he must use his newfound abilities to help his scrappy medieval town defend itself from hordes of bandits for three nights!
				</p>

				<p>
					The Story of Draden is a part action, part town management. Juggle boosting your town's population, gathering resources, and outfitting the townsfolk during the day, then put your combat skills to the test at night. 
				</p>

					My main contribution to the game was the NPC behavior and AI. I wrote a queueing system which allows the characters to switch actions by changing a priority variable, and the action with the highest priority actually occurs. By sending out time of day events using PubSub, 
					the NPC characters react to both their surroundings and the time of day. Additionally, when the player makes an item, I wrote the script that chooses which NPC picks it up. Additionally, I wrote the intro and ending cutscenes, as well as the tutorial at the beginning of the game.
				</p>
