				<h3><a href="https://mjustian.itch.io/494-zelda">Classic Game - The Legend of Zelda, First Dungeon</a></h3>
				<p>I worked with a group of 2 other people, specifically <a href="https://jackkolbert.github.io/">Jack Kolbert</a> and 
				<a href="https://alambkin.github.io">Azaan Lambkin</a> to create a remake of the Eagle dungeon from "The Legend of Zelda".
				My main contributions include writing the code for the UI, items, the boss, movement for the Keese (bat enemies), doors with keys,
				and map transitions, as well as adding sound.

				<h3><a href="https://mjustian.itch.io/monster-vs-mayor">Rapid Prototype - Monster vs. Mayor</a></h3>
				<p>This is a two-player city-building/city-smashing PC game that I made in two weeks. One player, using the mouse, must
					build a city. The other player controls a monster using the keyboard or a controller, and they must destroy that very city.
					I designed and programmed almost all aspects of the game, even learing 3D modeling with Blender. Some of the other assets,
					mainly sound effects, were from external sources.
