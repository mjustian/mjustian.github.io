				<h3>Classic Game - The Legend of Zelda, First Dungeon</h3>
				<p>I worked with a group of 2 other people, specifically <a href="https://jackkolbert.github.io/">Jack Kolbert</a> and 
				<a href="https://alambkin.github.io">Aazan Lambkin</a> to create a remake of the Eagle dungeon from "The Legend of Zelda".
				My main contributions include writing the code for the UI, items, the boss, movement for the Keese (bat enemies), 
				and map transitions, as well as adding sound.
